supervision
===========

Have you ever considered pluging in one project all of your personal tracking data?
May it be cameras at home or the backhauling of GPS data, having them managed by one tiny app?

That's what supervision is about: having a shedulers manager to collect all your private data.
Focus is put on the simplicity of use and pure REST API.

Requirements
------------

* rabbitmq-server 3.3
* python2.7
* celery 3.1
* Flask 0.10
* PIL 2.6
* records 0.4
* requests 2.4

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone http://github.com/drowolath/supervision.git
   $ cd supervision
   /supervision# python setup.py install

By now, supervision will be in your PYTHON PATH and importable.

Configuration
-------------

supervision will need configuration to be able to fetch data and organize them.
This configuration will be found in an INI file located at /etc/supervision/supervision.ini

Usage
-----

You should consider using supervisord to manage the Celery schedulers provided by supervision.
